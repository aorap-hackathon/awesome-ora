# Memecoin Lending
MemeCoin lending is a lending platform that uses a volatility prediction model to determine collateral rates. 

## Development flow

### Model Development
Create a volatility prediction model for meme coins using features like CEX listing, trading volume, age, and market cap.

### Training
Train a simple logistic regression or tree model to predict forward volatility.

### Collateral Rate Determination: 
Use the predicted volatility to set the collateral rates for meme coins.

### Risk Management:

Implement an over-collateralization strategy based on the predicted volatility.
Ensure dynamic adjustment of collateral rates, potentially managed by AI algorithms.
Include mechanisms for proactive liquidation of risky positions.
Utilize a collateral price map to prevent concentration of collateral at specific price ranges, reducing liquidation difficulties. 

### Challenges:
Data collection for training the model might be time-consuming.
Uncertainty in model effectiveness and implementation feasibility. This approach aims to manage the inherent risks of meme coin lending by maintaining conservative and dynamically adjustable collateral rates
