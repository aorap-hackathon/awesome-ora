# DAO Voter Apathy Solution

Sifting through extensive forum conversations and governance proposals can be daunting. Llama3 and OpenLM are capable of rapidly parsing massive data sets, and can make governance more efficient. These LLMs can distill complex proposals into succinct summaries, empowering stakeholders to make well-informed decisions without information overload.

These LLMs can also answer specific voter questions based on the specific proposal’s information, catering to diversities in voter knowledge/understanding

## Implementation steps

- Add a UX feature that connects to a verifiable LLM — a DAO member can request a summary of a proposal or ask specific questions about the proposal
- Connect UX feature to OAO
- User pays a small fee (or DAO subsidises cost) to receive neutral, decentralized, verifiable summaries and answers about the proposal displayed on the proposal’s page
