## üåç Overview

This list focuses on the work related to the ORA ecosystem.

This includes the [AI Oracle (OAO, Onchain AI Oracle)](https://mirror.xyz/orablog.eth/qLBIR_yxmpFJ4dg5p5Sn8Wz46aQDTG1jCW8myeE7zZ8) and [zkOracle](https://ethresear.ch/t/defining-zkoracle-for-ethereum/15131) ecosystem, the CLE ecosystem, the ERC ecosystem co-authored by ORA, and other ORA contributions.

Developers can leverage zkOracle's historical data access, and CLE's programmable zkVM-powered trustless compute to build decentralized application with more data and more compute.
