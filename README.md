## üåç Overview

This list focuses on the work related to the Hyper Oracle ecosystem.

This includes the [zkOracle](https://ethresear.ch/t/defining-zkoracle-for-ethereum/15131) ecosystem, the [zkGraph](https://docs.hyperoracle.io/zkgraph/introduction) ecosystem, the ERC ecosystem co-authored by Hyper Oracle, and other Hyper Oracle contributions.

Developers can leverage zkOracle's historical data access, and zkGraph's programmable zkVM-powered trustless compute to build decentralized application with more data and more compute.

## üîÆ zkOracle Ecosystem

_A Collection of Projects Using Hyper Oracle zkOracle._
