## üåç Overview

This list focuses on the work related to the Hyper Oracle ecosystem.

This includes the [zkOracle](https://ethresear.ch/t/defining-zkoracle-for-ethereum/15131) ecosystem, the [zkGraph](https://docs.hyperoracle.io/zkgraph/introduction) ecosystem, the ERC ecosystem co-authored by Hyper Oracle, and other Hyper Oracle contributions.

Developers can leverage zkOracle's historical data access, and zkGraph's programmable zkVM-powered trustless compute to build decentralized application with more data and more compute.

## üîÆ zkOracle Ecosystem

_A Collection of Projects Using Hyper Oracle zkOracle._

- [zkAMM](https://github.com/Defi-3/zkAMM-contracts): A zkOracle-based automated market maker that is fully scalable with unlimited computation resources.
- [dETF](https://github.com/Defi-3/dETF-Contract): A zkOracle-based fully onchain and decentralized ETF.
- [Unic](https://twitter.com/viaprize/status/1711312453219524638): A decentralized identity platform, using zkOracle for onchain ML.
- [ZKredible](https://twitter.com/viaprize/status/1711312450405159377): A privacy-preserving and censorship-resistant credit record evaluation system, using zkOracle for onchain aggregation of zkML.

## üó∫Ô∏è zkGraph Ecosystem

_A List of zkGraphs Built by Hyper Oracle and Community._

- [zkGraph Examples](https://github.com/hyperoracle/zkgraph/tree/b9fe1a6c2efd7e6a5793c47799da8745c1c748c4/example): A list of zkGraphs, including Uniswap Price Calculation, zkAutomation-based zkGraph, and multi-address based zkGraph. This is the implementation by Hyper Oracle.
- [zkUsecases](https://github.com/LiRiu/zkUsecases): A list of zkGraphs, including SeaPort Trading Activity, and USDT Transfer Volume Per Block. This is displayed on Hyper Oracle's [use case page](https://www.hyperoracle.io/app/cases).
- [Marine](https://github.com/hyperoracle/marine/): A zkGraph for liquidation on Compound Protocol. This is tracking 15+ addresses, and 90+ events at the same time.
- [zkToken](https://github.com/hyperoracle/zkToken): A zkGraph as ERC20 token monitor. This monitors whether there is any selling or pumping behavior in the whale account, and then issue an alert signal.
